## Features
- **Scale**: Contains over 20 million molecules, 71 times more than the largest existing dataset.
- **Comprehensive Modalities**:
- One-dimensional SMILES strings
- Two-dimensional molecular graphs
- Three-dimensional molecular structures
- Physicochemical properties
- Text descriptions
- **Diverse Applications**: Supports various downstream tasks such as molecule generation, molecular property prediction, lead optimization, virtual screening, pharmacokinetics modeling, and drug-target interaction prediction.

## Dataset Details
M<sup>3</sup>-20M integrates data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of each molecule. Hereâ€™s what you can find in the dataset:
- M^3_Original.csv: Descriptions from PubChem
- M^3_Physicochemical.csv: Physicochemical properties
- M^3_Description_Physicochemical.csv: Descriptions composed of physicochemical properties
- M^3_Multi.csv: Descriptions from PubChem, physicochemical properties, and those generated by GPT-3.5
- MPP folder: Contains multimodal datasets for molecular property prediction (BBBP-MM, BACE-MM, HIV-MM, ClinTox-MM, Tox21-MM)
- MOSES-Multi folder: Contains MOSES multimodal datasets for molecular generation
- QM9-Multi folder: Contains QM9 multimodal datasets

## Functions
We provide convenient functions that allow you to easily obtain the dataset, as well as the 2D and 3D representations of any molecule outside the dataset. The specific functions can be found in the Function folder.

## Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to load and explore the dataset:

```
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('path-to-dataset.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())
```
